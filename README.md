This is where I am learning NLTK library in Python 

I am working through this series of lectures

Each lecture corrosponds to a single .py file where I follow along with the lecturer. 

Sometimes when I don't know about the internals of an Algorithm I will look it up else where and write up the process for it. 

After I finish the lecture series I plan on making several blog posts about different interest parts in it.

Right now I am planning on writing up explanation of the internals and pros and cons of different Naive Bayes Algorithms and Support Vector Machine Algorithms.
