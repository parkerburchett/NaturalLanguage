1. create a git repository using a virtual env with only the files you need it to.
This is things like numpy, scipy, nltk, VoteClassifier, NaturalLanguage.custom_nltk_utils.

2. Build a very simple website where you can pass in a string and it will write out to the website
 time to setup
 VoteClassifer.explain_choice(user_sentence)
 You pass in a string. It prints out an answer.
