If you want ot know more you should do this:

Since Accuracy/N/ classifer are hightly corrilated you don't need to train every 5 classifer. 

It would be better to just do the fastest. Prob Naive Bayes 10 time at every level. 

You could leave this going over night.

You would want to find a way of doing this faster on your computer since right now it is going to take several hours.





Need to find a way of making it much faster than what it is now.
