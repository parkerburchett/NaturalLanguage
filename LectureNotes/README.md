#NaturalLanguage
This is where I am learning NLTK library in Python

I am working through this series of lectures https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDf2JswnfiGkliBInZnIC4HL
Each lecture corresponds to a single .py file where I follow along with the lecturer.

Sometimes when I don't know about the internals of an algorithm I will look it up elsewhere and write up the process for it.

I am writing up the some of the interesting parts of the code on my blog: www.parkerburchett.com
